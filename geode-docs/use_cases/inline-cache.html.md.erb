An inline cache holds region entries for a client application.

## Description of an Inline Cache

An inline cache holds data for quick access.
The inline cache comprises 
a Geode region together with code deployed to servers that host 
the region.
The inline cache sits between the client application and a
backing data store.
The server-deployed code communicates with the backend data store.

The client application's cache lookup is a region get
operation, and a cache write is a region put operation. 

When the cache (region) has the requested region entry,
it quickly responds with the value for a lookup operation.
This is a cache hit.
If the requested region entry is not in the region,
it is a cache miss,
and the code deployed to the server acquires the
entry from the data store.
<GEODE> writes the
acquired region entry to the region
such that future lookups will cause a cache hit.
